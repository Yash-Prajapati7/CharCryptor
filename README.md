# CharCryptor
## Description :
**CharCryptor** is a text encryption algorithm designed to encode and decode strings using a custom character shifting algorithm. It ensures data security by altering each character based on a unique key, making the original text unreadable without the correct decryption key. This project is ideal for securely storing and transmitting sensitive information.
## Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or simply copy paste the code.
2. Navigate to the directory of the desired programming language (e.g., `java`, `c`, `cpp`, `python`).
3. Input text for encryption or decryption and follow the prompts provided by the program.
